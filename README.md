#Calculator, alligator!

In this project, a calculator with basic arithmetics was built in HTML, CSS and plain vanilla Javascript. The challenge was to not use the Javascript function `eval()` since it is open for malicious attacks [click here for more info](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval#Do_not_ever_use_eval!). 

##Challenges
This project contains several other challenges:
- Consider precedence (e.g. 4 + 3 * 2 should equal 10 and not 14)
- The user cannot divide by 0
- Answers should be rounded if it is a float
- Create backspace- and clear-buttons for new user input
- Allow the user to enter floating numbers 
- Make it look nice
